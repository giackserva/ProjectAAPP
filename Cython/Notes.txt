******General on data structure
HEAD has key 0
NIL has key UINT_MAX
level and maxLevel are unsigned short int

****** Program
* testsuite.py
  simply run python3.6 testsuite.py

* profile.py(x)
  from a python interpreter, import my_profile and invoke my_profile.start()
  or my_profile.deep_profile().
  Important: disable the logger (or set it to ERROR) to avoid logging
  overhead when profiling.
  Important2: do not rename the file to profile.py otherwise the python 
  interpreter will get crazy

* Faster string concatenation
  From profiling the main problems seem related to methods like node_to_string
  where there is a lot of string concatenation. I decided to use the approach
  mentioned in Method 4 here https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/

******General on Cython

* To compile pyx
  python3.6 setup.py build_ext --inplace

* Avoid using c strings
  http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html

* Better to use C random generator
  http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/MC_cython/main_MC_cython.html

* cdef: callable only from c code
  cpdef: callable both from c and python code (e.g. python interpreter)

******General on numpy
* error: numpy/arrayobject.h: No such file or directory
